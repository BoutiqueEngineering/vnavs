        This class isolates low level hardware functions so that helmsman is vehicle
        agnostic. Right now it is hardwired for my initial robot. Later on it will
        either be subclassed or specilaized with a configuration file.

        For now, speed variables are actual Arduino Servo values. Eventually
        we want them to use actual speed mm/sec and map that to whatever
